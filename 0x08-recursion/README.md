# Projects description for project 0x08-recursion
## Basic compulsary tasks.
task 0. **She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
> Protoype: __void _puts_recursion(char *s);__

task 1. **Why is it so important to dream? Because we are together.**
Write a function that prints a string in inverse.
> Protoytpe: __void _Print_rev_recursion(char *s);__

task 2. **Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.**
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
> Protoype: __int _strlen_recursion(char *s);__

task 3. **You musn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.**
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
> Prototype: __int factorial(int n);__
> If n is lower than _0_, the function should return _-1_ to indicate an error.
> Factorial of _0_ is _1_.

task 4. **Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almosrt impossible to eradicate.**
Write a function that returns the value of _x_ raised to the power of _y_.
> Prototype: __int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);__
> If _y_ is lower than _0_, the function should return _-1_.

task 5. **Your subconsious is looking for the dreamer**
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
> Prototype: __int _sqrt_recursion(int n);__
> If _n_ does not have a natural square root, the function should return _-1_.

task 6. **Inception. Is it possible?**
Write a function that returns _1_ if the input integer is a _prime number_, otherwise return _0_.
> prototype: __int is_prime_number(int n);__
